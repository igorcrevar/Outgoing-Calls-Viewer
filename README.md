Checkout your outgoing calls statistics.

This program reads call logs from your telephone and do not backup or make copy of that data. It just present call data
in convenient way. Because your telephone might delete call logs after some period of time, you may not be able to see statistics for more than X months in the past.

You can see on who you spend most minutes, on which days, etc...
Also data can be presented with two charts (one for daily calls, other for monthly).

You can specify when your payment month begin, minute rounding politics of your mobile network operator

Note that your mobile network operator calculates minutes differently, so small deviation between program and "real" spent minutes are possible.
